< Didn't get 62K R's in mouser order. 
	*missed in Mouser BOM, did not order
	>added to std bom and fix bom

< Didn't get 4v1 power supply
	*missed in Mouser BOM, did not order
	>added to std bom and fix bom

< Didn't get 3x0.1 header
	*missed in Mouser BOM, did not order
	>added to std bom and fix bom

< Simcard footprint wrong, 
	*needs larger keepout area
	> increased boundry lines in layout model
 
	*ground shell
	> Was grounded, no change 

	*alignment pegs
	> added pegs in layout model

	*Found Part number refrence was wrong
	>updated in model
	>updated model in part assosciation file

< USB micro footprint wrong, prongs, ground shell
	*part/footpring not the same
	> used data sheet to make a new part
	> updated model in part assosciation file

< USB-A, ground shell
	>not actually a problem, no change

47nF caps on BOM instead of 47nH 0603 inductors
	*missed in Mouser BOM, did not order
	>added to std bom and fix bom

4.7uf caps are 0805 instead of 0603
	*wrong in Mouser BOM
	>added new to std bom and fix bom

220ohm FB are 0805 instead of 0603
	*wrong in Mouser BOM
	>added new to std bom and fix bom

serial connector footprint wrong, longer
	*wrong size on board, can be hacked
	>Created new part in library to match mouser BOM item

D1 footprint wrong, way too big
	*wasted PCB space
	>changed model in part assosciation file

RF connector footprint wrong, needs wider
	*Model not correct
	>used data sheet to fix model
